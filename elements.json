Mason mixes up their ultra-flavored, cold-infused batches in a small walk-in nestled in the back of the company's tiny Brooklyn storefront. Silky smooth and perfectly emulsified, you'll find yourself making up excuses to grab one of these jars at every meal.\nTIP OF THE TONGUE\nSlather this mayo on crusty french bread to pair with pickled carrots, jalapeño and soy-marinated hanger steak for a riff on the bânh mi.

    "description": "This extra-special delicacy from the Gruyere district of Switzerland is well-known as the basic ingredient in fondue. But with its delightfully nutty, spicy, full flavor, it is delicious as a table cheese as well. Upon eating Gruyere, one immediately recognizes the taste of whole milk that is used exclusively in making this grand cheese. We say it is grand because a whole wheel of Gruyere weighs about 80 pounds. In fact, it takes over 100 gallons of milk to make a single wheel of Gruyere! Enjoy this traditional favorite julienned into a chef's salad, melted on a hot open-faced sandwich, or, of course, in a classic cheese fondue.",

    "description": "To paraphrase Julia Child, a little butter makes life a lot better. We like to butter up our toast with butter from one of our favorite New England creameries, Vermont Creamery because we know their craftsmanship is top of the cream-line. While working on a dairy farm in Brittany, France, Vermont Creamery's Allison Hooper learned a thing or two about churning cultured cream (crème fraiche) into thick, buttery butter. Churned in small batches, the cream transforms into a rich European-style butter with 86% butterfat and fresh off the farm taste. Cultured Butter is great for baking, pan searing meats, on your toast, and slathered all over...you get the idea. This butter's like buttah. Salted or Unsalted.",

    "description": "MOUTH SAYS...\nNo no, it's not the end of days, but a taste of this whiskey is pretty earth-shattering!\nYes, this is a big and brawny whiskey with a rich, full body and tons of black pepper. The alluring hints of chocolate and freshly baked pastry (really!) make it perfect to sip alongside dessert. It's a must-have bottle for rye whiskey fans everywhere.\nHere's the deal: Corsair master distiller Darek Bell ferments 80% malted rye and 20% un-malted chocolate rye from local farms, then distills the mash once in an antique still and a second time in a modern copper pot still. It's then aged for around a year in 15 gallon casks before being brought to proof and bottled by hand.\nDID YOU KNOW?\n100% rye whiskeys are particularly difficult to distill, because the fermented mash is incredibly sticky and hard to handle. We're super impressed that a number of small batch distillers have taken on the challenge, with tasty success!",

Then, they take this classic and give it one more twist: Bourbon Barrel smoked honey that adds just a wisp of smoke to every sip. \nHello, happy hour! These cocktails are as easy to make as they are to drink, and we love that the syrup is made with all organic ingredients. We'll drink to that (and did we mention how gorgeous the bottle is?!). \nTIP OF THE TONGUE\nWe like to pair this syrup with Great Lakes Distillery's Kinnickinnic Whiskey.

It's sweet and tropical, with a melt-in-your-mouth creaminess that we can't get enough of. We'll never give up peanut butter, but this spread is our new favorite alternative to fruity jellies and citrusy marmalades. \nTIP OF THE TONGUE\nSpoon up coconut jam, known as srikaya in Indonesia, for a breakfast plate of Malaysian kaya toast.

But by the time he'd finished his college degree, they'd already sold the farm. It wasn't until he needed a stellar fresh chèvre for a local dinner he was organizing that he met Allison Hooper. Allison worked at a local dairy lab in Vermont to help supply the cheese, and the rest was cheesy history.

Makes for an extremely healthy side dish.\nTo cook beans on your stove-top, combine soaked or dried beans, water, oil or fat, and seasonings in a saucepan or pot of appropriate size. Bring the beans to a boil, reduce the heat, then cover and simmer until beans are tender. This takes 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending on the bean variety. Check the beans occasionally to see if they are covered with the cooking liquid. If there is so much liquid absorption and evaporation that the top of the beans becomes exposed, add very hot tap water to the pot to cover the beans. When dried beans boil, a foam forms on the top of the cooking liquid. This foam is water-soluble protein released from the beans and it will be absorbed back into the bean cooking liquid. It is not necessary to remove the foam. (To keep the foam down when cooking beans, add 1 Tablespoon of butter, drippings (consider flavor), or vegetable salad oil, for each cup of beans.",

In Thailand, devoted farmers are proud to have achieved organic certification of their traditional coconut crop. While organic coconuts are generally smaller than their conventional counterparts, organically managed trees are more robust and drought-resistant, and their soil is more rich and moisture retentive. The first pressing of the fresh organic coconut meat yields an oil-rich extract that is mixed only with filtered water and a tiny amount (less than 1%) of guar gum from the seeds of the guar plant. The result is Native Forest® Classic Organic Coconut Milk, a delicious ingredient in soups, curries, sauces, desserts, and beverages. It may also replace dairy milk or cream in some of your favorite American recipes with excellent results.",

    "description": "MOUTH SAYS...\nGlory, glory, hallelujah!\nThis gin is just as tasty with tonic as it is in a strong cocktail.\nWhile all gins must contain juniper, a distiller can add any other botanicals they want to craft their own unique flavor. Most distillers keep the recipe secret, but our neighbors at Breuckelen Distilling proudly revealed their secrets –  lemon, rosemary, ginger and grapefruit.\nUnlike many gins that are basically infused vodkas, Breuckelen's gin is distilled from wheat grown in upstate New York, so the base is really more like a white whiskey. In fact, they barrel-age the same wheat spirit to make their 77 Whiskey.  \nTIP OF THE TONGUE\nThe warm ginger note makes it just right paired with Morris Kitchen's ginger syrup. For a deliciously easy cocktail, combine 2 oz gin, 1 oz syrup and 1/2 oz lemon juice over ice and stir until cold, then top with a little seltzer.\nDID YOU KNOW?\nGin can be infused with a wide variety of botanicals, but it MUST contain juniper berries, which are responsible for that distinct, piney, gin-y flavor.",

    "description": "MOUTH SAYS...\nBig and full-bodied, with lots of ripe fruit and a hint of black pepper and vanilla, this is a classic \"Cali Cab Sav blend\" with enough age to show off delicious maturity.\nNothing says California red wine like predominately Cabernet Sauvignon aged in oak casks. And this mix of 75% Cab Sav with 25% Petite Syrah is truly one of the best we've ever tasted. The 2 grape varietals grow next to each other in the vineyard in California's Dry Creek Valley which makes them a perfect compliment to each other, and the wine spends 20 months in French oak before bottling. (Ah, retirement.)\nThe folks at Old World make wines that not only taste wonderful, but also are true to their vineyards. They never add yeast because they think the native yeast better expresses the wine's origins, much like soil and growing conditions tie grapes to certain regions.\nTIP OF THE TONGUE\nWe were thrilled to get a Cabernet blend this good, with this much age, for this price. Grab one to drink now and one to open in a few more years.",

    "description": "Dry but fruity flavors of pear, quince and grapefruit gain complexity from notes of green thyme and smoky volcanic rock.\nStory: Reds from Sicily's Mount Etna have been impressing for years now, but the region also makes excellent white wines. The main varieties, Carricante and Catarratto, are indigenous and obscure, yet they wonderfully evoke a unique winegrowing environment: the terroir of an active volcano. Still erupting with a continuously visible plume of smoke, the 10,900-foot summit of Mount Etna possesses a vastly cooler climate than that of the sea-level vineyards below. That, combined with the area's minerally, volcanic soils, makes for an extreme grape-growing environment that stresses vines into producing extraordinary wine. Sure, vineyards are occasionally lost to lava flows, but many old vines survive to produce wines that have the acid, structure and precision people usually associate with northern Italian wines. We think that Etna is one of the most compelling regions in the world, and this crisp bottling does it great credit.\nSense: The nose brings together scents of yellow plum, pear and lemon verbena with hints of seashells and minerals.\nSavor: Dry but fruity flavors of pear, quince and grapefruit gain complexity from notes of green thyme and smoky volcanic rock.\nServe: This wine has the tightness, high acidity and aggressive minerality to be compelling on its own as an aperitif. But that same stony texture and lemon-tinged bite make it wonderful with food, especially fresh fish and seafood. Serve white-fleshed fish, scallops, shrimp, clams—whatever you can find from the sea—simply with lemon, capers, olive oil, herbs and other Mediterranean seasonings for a great first course or a satisfying light meal.\nServing Instructions: Serve well chilled - refrigerate the bottle for 45 minutes before serving.",

    "description": "Hailed as the \"king of rices,\" Carnaroli delivers a satisfying bite when cooked, making it an ideal choice for risotto and rice salads. Our Carnaroli rice is from the Grange Vercellesi, a famous rice-growing area in Italy's Piedmont, where it is produced for us by a fifth-generation family business devoted to low environmental impact farming. The long, firm grains are prepared using traditional stone husking, a gentle method that retains the nutrients in the outermost layer of the grain, enhancing the taste and texture of the cooked rice.  Simmer gently in stock while slowly stirring to release the natural starches, and you'll have a risotto that is rich and creamy yet perfectly al dente.",
